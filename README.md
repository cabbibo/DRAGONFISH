todo:

 // - death dragon not attacking properly
  - getting matrix inverses for 0 for some of the objects
//  - objets not showing up when added to next scene. // This is happening when a geometry is instantiated the level before, but for some reason it doesn't change for this level... ( hacked by creating geometry, than removing it )
 
 // - first set of objects added to scene 2 times? figure out what is different for this set than the rest, and you will have your answer!

 /* - Death dragon needs to be placed properly for each level! ( now the plume must be placed properly too... ) ( could also remove.... would certainly be more efficient.... )*/


 // - assignUVs  bug: somehow, this is screwing with the proper assigning of attributes? why oh why would this be?


  //- something about scores is not lining up right? makes certain levels impossible to beat?
 //     - probably has something to do with teh way that death destroys objects? ( not destroying an object on the upper left hand score counter, but object isn't there ? )


  //- Plume of dragonfish takes some time to catch up. Working on creating recursive call in 'startDeath' , but it doesn't seem to be working... jumps to some place that is *kinda* close and follows while osscilating quickly.


  //- Go through and make all the guides match the level they are being added to

  - Death for 2nd part of every level not working...

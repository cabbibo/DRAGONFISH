todo:

  - death dragon not attacking properly
  - getting matrix inverses for 0 for some of the objects
  - objets not showing up when added to next scene. // This is happening when a geometry is instantiated the level before, but for some reason it doesn't change for this level... ( hacked by creating geometry, than removing it )
  - first set of objects added to scene...





  - Attribute bug: When normal material not created, doesn't properly assign normals?

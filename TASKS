- Instructions
  - how to move ( x ) if not moving mouse
  - how to move ( z ) if not pressing mouse
  - how to catch creatures

- Death
  - Good introduction that strikes fear
  - When eaten, place Death far away, so it chases you again.
  - Maybe some sort of words spewing out of mouth ??!?! ( IM COMING TO GET YOU, etc )
  - Much bigger todo when hit by death ( pieces explode, etc );
  - Respawn missing pieces so you can recollect the audio ?!?!
  - Some way that you get to beat it at the end? maybe last level, all the heads are skulls,
    so you feel like you are beating it? 

  - 1,2 no death , 3,4 slow death , 5,6 fast death , 7,8 no death, but you get to collect skulls ?

- Credit level
  - really awesome piece for each person, with text above its head?!?!
  - possible once you catch, it pops up contact / twitter info?
  - Smaller 'thank you' creatures for robbie, ryan berkey , doob , reza , etc
  - should be GOLD AS FUCK



- Design

  - Different level types? Possibly different parts of the body? first level set is eye,
    second level set is mouth, third level set is hand, etc ?!?! obviously doesn't need to be intentional,

  - has to be a 'pink noise eyeball' level, its just a must!


- Easter egg?!?!

  fly far enough away for secret level?!?! 


- Bugs:

  when you destroy the boss while still fading in, it will not fade out!
